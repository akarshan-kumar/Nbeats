Nbeats.ipynb file is used to train on 75% of the Time Series data. A generic pipeline is made to prepare the data and hypertune the model parameters for every dataset(i.e. .csv file). Dataset_Benchmarking_for_Nbeats.ipynb is used to predict values using the remaining 25% of the data and is also used to generate the benchmarking plots. Benchmark plots.pdf contains all the time-series plots with yTrue and pred values.
